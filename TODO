- add augmentation to ocroline, ocroseg
- morphology for blockseg

- detect bad word output from posterior probabilities
- lines2blocks (align line-based page recognition w/ground truth, json based)
- line2word with bi and trigrams
- ground truth alignment (n-gram, whole line)
- page frame / noise removal
- union-find for line segmentation
- text generation and degradation
- implement rotation, skew, and scale detection
- rename ocroline->ocrotext
- word-based training on UW3
- simple optional global word size normalization and centering
- batched word recognition (for speed)
- set up full training pipeline in Docker container (continuous training and regression)
- words2lines (align word-based page recognition w/ground truth, json based)
- words2lines -- special output for math, formulas (anything containing {}\): return <<ANY>>

DONE:

- line2words (recognize line image and split on space)
- optional line normalizer
