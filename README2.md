TODO:

- initial
  - segment -- full page segmentation based on markers
  - recognize -- word or line recognition, with or without dewarping
  - simpledeskew -- old deskewing (hardcoded, or use Kraken)
  - nlbin -- old binarization (hardcoded, or use Kraken)
- next
  - pagegen -- page text generation (using HTML rendering, shapes, images; wkhtmltoimage or puppeteer)
  - degrade -- document image degradation
  - deskew -- page deskewing (including rotation detection)
  - binarize -- image binarization (nlbin clone and inverse degradation)
  - upscale -- grayscale upscaling (inverse downscaling)
- more
  - approxgt -- training with approximate ground truth (text -> n-grams -> hyphenation -> training)
  - semseg -- semantic segmentation / text region detection (general image -> class; models for images, tables, figures, seps)
  - lineseg -- line-based segmenter for binary images (used for line recognizer or assembling word recognizer output, text detection, small vs large text, horizontal vs vertical)
  - langmod -- language modeling with OpenFST
  - correct -- DL based correction
  - dewarp -- line and page dewarping
  - gandegrade -- document image degradation using GAN techniques
  - scenegen -- scene text generation
  - errgen -- error-based training data generation
  - readingorder -- reading order determination

- segment
  - actually treat 0 as don't care class
  - incorporate traininer and make it # sample based
  - amp/apex FP16 option for inference
  - data augmentation option during training (class SimpleDocumentAugmentation)
  - green boundary consistency check (total green by distance for each marker, via edt and sources)
  - update loss outliers less
  - do something for isolated lower case letters (make the blue portion bigger)
  - global page LSTM context
  - two stage: text line detection, then use that as input for separator detection
  - possibly use dynamic programming groundtruth
  - loc-min-max-loss for training
  - try MSE or multiclass

- more
  - style GAN
  - latent font style etc.
  - "same document" detector LSTM->vec, siamese or deep-nn
